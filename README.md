# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This Python program utilizes the Pygame library to create a sorting algorithm visualizer. The visualizer supports various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort. Users can interact with the visualizer by resetting the list, choosing the sorting algorithm, toggling between ascending and descending order, and starting/pausing the sorting process.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pygame

Installation command for pygame:
```cmd
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run
- Download the source code.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
- Run the program using the command: python main.py

## Usage
- Reset List (R): Generates a new random list for sorting.
- Start/Pause Sorting (SPACE): Initiates or pauses the sorting process.
- Toggle Ascending/Descending Order (A/D): Switches between sorting in ascending or descending order.
- Select Sorting Algorithm:
    - Bubble Sort (B): Bubble Sort algorithm.
    - Insertion Sort (I): Insertion Sort algorithm.
    - Merge Sort (M): Merge Sort algorithm.
    - Selection Sort (S): Selection Sort algorithm.
- Quit (Closing the window or pressing Q): Exits the visualizer.

## Visual Representation
- The graphical window displays bars representing the elements of the list.
- Each step of the sorting algorithm is visually highlighted with different colors to provide a clear understanding of the sorting process.
